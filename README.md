# basicJS-quiz

Multi-choice quiz to test basic JavaScript knowledge, a timer begins once the quiz is started but if a question is answered incorrectly time is reduced. Should the time reach zero the game is over and is considered a fail, however if all questions are answered with time to spare that is logged as the score.
