# basicJS-quiz

Multi-choice quiz to test basic JavaScript knowledge, a timer begins once the quiz is started but if a question is answered incorrectly time is reduced. Should the time reach zero the game is over and is considered a fail, however if all questions are answered with time to spare that can be logged as the final score. Scores are logged onto the local storage and the list can be continuously updated or reset to start fresh.
